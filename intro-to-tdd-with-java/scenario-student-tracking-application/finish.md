## Putting it all together

We have come full circle. We have seen how TDD works and have a basic understanding of it. The idea of writing unit tests before the actual code itself though may seem like an odd practice for some. It is important to understand the *why* behind TDD.

### Why TDD?
Most teams will use TDD as a means to improve their test coverage. There are other benefits though:
- Tests act as living documentation of implemented functionality
- Breaks development into manageable chunks
- Implemented tests are an observable marker of progress
- Adds a gamification aspect to development
- Allows for an organic design process
- Built in refactoring cycles

### TDD is an investment
Let's face it, TDD requires an investment from the team.

- There is friction initially to learning and applying the methodolgy
- TDD requires a shift in mindset
- Developers may be learning adjacent testing skills as well
- Developers are probably writing more tests and doing more refactoring than before

When starting out, we will notice that our code is being written at a slower pace. That is okay! Once the team becomes more comfortable with practicing TDD, we often see a long term velocity increase and less errors in a production environment.
